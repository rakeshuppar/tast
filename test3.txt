1. 
  1.public static void main(){String[] args}

 public=It is access specifier, we can accesss class from same or different packages;
 static=It is non access specifier 
 void- cant return any value
 main - it is a method
 {String[] args}= command line arguement in the string form;


 2. Class=It is blue print of an object,We create class with Class Keyword
         Class is a keyword
         It logical entity,It does not exist in the real world. 
         we can store the states and behaviour,
         class is also datatype

  Object=It is real world entity,It exist in the real world,It is having properies like States and behaviour.
         

  3.JVM=Java Virtual Machine
    The main function of jvm is it is an interpreter which convert byte code to machine code.
    it provides runtime environment to execute bytecode
    
  JRE=Java Runtime Environmen
    To execute byte code minimun Jre required ;
    It contains JVM and development tools
  JDK=JAva Development Kit
     It is software kit which contains JDk+set of libraries.


4.Constructor;
    It is special type of method which is use to initialize the objects.
    It doesnot have return type;
    It is same as classname.
    
  Tyes of constructor

  Default constructor:
  If there is  no constructor available in the class java compiler provides  default constructor by
  default is called Default constructor.

  Parameterized Constructor:
  It is also type of constructor in which it having parameters is called Parameterized Constructor.


5.
this keyword=It refering to current object,the this keyword is in the scope of the that class only;
   
this()= It refering to current method,the this keyword is in the scope of the that method only;


7.main method is static because we can create instance of the class only one copy.we cannot create multiple copies.

  Types methods:
  1.predefined-Methods are already defined in Java.
    static-Method are with static keyword. 
    non static- Methods are without static keyword.

  2.Userdefined-Methods are defined by users or programmers.
    static-Method are with static keyword. 
    non-static- Methods are without static keyword.

10.Yes,we have private constructor but we cannot initialize

   Yes we can overload the constructor.

Example-  

        class test{

         public test(){
           //no arg constructor
          }

          public test(String name,int number){
          this.name=name;
          this.number=number;
          }
         }  


11.

public static void main(String [] args){

public int[] num=[12,3,2,45,6,7,6]

for(int i=0,i=i<num.length,i++){
   system.out.in(num.length);
}
}
